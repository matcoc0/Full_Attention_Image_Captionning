# Full Attention Image Captioning

**Final Project – Neural Networks & Deep Learning (ESILV 2025)**  
**Authors:** Mathieu Cowan, Adrien de Mailly Nesle, Alaric de Bastard  

## Description

This repository contains our final project on **Image Captioning with Attention**, developed as part of the ESILV Neural Networks and Deep Learning course.

The model combines a **CNN encoder** and an **LSTM decoder** with a **visual attention mechanism**, allowing the system to generate natural language descriptions of images.

The complete implementation, results, and visualizations are available in the HTML report below.

- Dataset preprocessing (Flickr8k subset)  
- CNN–LSTM with Attention architecture  
- Model training and evaluation (BLEU score)  
- Caption examples with attention visualization  


## Summary of Key Points

- **Dataset:** Flickr8k (3k images subset)  
- **Model:** ResNet-18 encoder + LSTM decoder + attention  
- **Framework:** PyTorch  
- **Metrics:** BLEU score  
- **Goal:** Generate meaningful captions for unseen images
