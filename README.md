# Full Attention Image Captioning

**Final Project – Neural Networks & Deep Learning (ESILV 2025)**  
**Authors:** Mathieu Cowan, Adrien de Mailly Nesle, Alaric de Bastard  

## Description

This repository contains our final project on **Image Captioning with Attention**, developed as part of the ESILV Neural Networks and Deep Learning course.

The model combines a **CNN encoder** and an **LSTM decoder** with a **visual attention mechanism**, allowing the system to generate natural language descriptions of images.

The complete implementation, results, and visualizations are available in the HTML report below.
